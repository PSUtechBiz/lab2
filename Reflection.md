# My Reflection / Blog

For this week's lab I decided to add a course description to the Readme file. This was a learning experience for me (even though we did it in class last Wednesday) because I forgot some of the paths to take. In my video I walk through the steps I took to edit the file. As the semester goes on I hope to become more comfortable recording myself.
